# Distributed-KVStore 🚀

A hands-on C++ project to build a scalable, distributed key-value store from the ground up. Using log-structured storage principles, this project aims to evolve step-by-step from simple foundations toward a robust, extensible system.

---

## Project Goals 🎯

- Build a performant, durable key-value store using log-structured storage techniques.  
- Start with a simple, hash-indexed storage engine as the foundation.  
- Progressively implement advanced storage layers and distributed system features.  
- Write clean, modular C++ code with testing and documentation.  
- Learn and apply core concepts of storage systems and distributed computing through practical implementation.

# Current Milestones 🛠️ 
## Hash-Indexed Storage Engine

- [ ] Implement an append-only log for data durability.  
- [ ] Maintain an in-memory hash index for fast key lookups.  
- [ ] Support basic operations: `put(key, value)`, `get(key)`, and `delete(key)`.  
- [ ] Handle log compaction to reclaim storage space.  
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure correctness, maintainability, and ease of refactoring.
